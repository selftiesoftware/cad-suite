  ## ABOUT SIIGNA

  Siigna is an online open-source 2-dimensional CAD application that runs online on
  the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine JAVA virtual machine].
  It is intended to suit the needs of different groups. Therefore the backbone of
  Siigna, the mainline, is relatively small and a majority of functionality is
  branched out into modules. The idea is that Siigna can be loaded with different sets
  of modules, creating different modes for generating different types of artwork.

  ## SIIGNA MODULES

  This is the default Siigna modules. Modules contain a default set of drawing
  tools that allow users to create and manipulate artwork in the Siigna application.
  It is possible replace or add to the default modules to facilitate different
  drawing functionality, or even to create a whole new set of tools for manipulating
  text, linework and polygons. So in principle, Siigna could be expanded to become a 
  platform for digital text editing, typesetting and layout, scripting based graphics, 
  electronic circuit board creation. 
  '- Anything which can be represented as text and/or linework.

  ## SIIGNA MAINLINE

  The application itself is coded in the [https://github.com/siigna/mai MAINLINE],
  which run independent of the modules. The Mainline uses a system for sending
  commands via messages, allowing entire drawings or parts of drawings to be sent
  dynamically and viewed on other instances of Siigna in real time.
